%MIXED EVENT ANALYSIS
*mea_left.C (Sep. 5, 2020)
[-17ns,-15ns] (1 bunch is used)

*mea_right.C (Sep. 5, 2020)
[15ns,17ns] (1 bunch is used)

*mea_center.C (Sep. 5, 2020)
[-5ns,-3ns] (1 bunch is used)

*mea_pion.C (Sep. 5, 2020)
[2ns,4ns] (1 bunch is used)

*mea_compare.C (Sep. 5, 2020)
-comparison of above four-type MEA results (mea_left.C, mea_right.C, mea_center.C, mea_pion)

*mea_lcr.C (Sep. 13, 2020)
[-17ns,-15ns], [-5,-3], [13,15] (3 bunch is used, 2.012 ns width)

*mea_lll.C (Sep. 13, 2020)
[-19ns,-17ns], [-17,-15], [-15,-13] (3 bunch is used, 2.012 ns width)

*mea_rrr.C (Sep. 13, 2020)
[9ns,11ns], [13,15], [15,17] (3 bunch is used, 2.012 ns width)

*mea_llccrr_new.C => mea_llccrr_new_RHRSz5partition.C
[-19ns,-17ns], [-17ns,-15ns], [-5ns,-3ns], [-3ns,-1ns], [11ns,13ns], [13ns,15ns] (6 bunch is used, 2.012 ns width, L single, CM Angle cut)
--> bgmea_Lsingle_new.root (2020.10.18)
--> bgmea_Lsingle_new.root (2020.11.18) w/ Doubling problem ammended, w/ h2all_Lsingle_1 & h2all_Lsingle_2
(--> bgmea_Lsingle.root was mistaken at CM angle cut, it should have set to false in every loop.) 
(--> Files without "Lsingle" label are old. = Multi-track analysis) 

--> after Update of Cointime (2020.11.21) => bgmea_2020Nov.root
--> hmm => hcs(Lab) were added (2020.11.22), "hmm" is same as before => bgmea_csbase.root
*mea_llccrr_new.C (Nov. 23, 2020 Update!)
--> z partition: 10
--> Qsq, theta_gk_cm partition  

*mea_mthesis.C
basically, identical with "mea_mthesis.C"
GeV --> MeV
