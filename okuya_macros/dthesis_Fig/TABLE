FPcut_comp.C & FPmom_comp.C
- Comparison of FP cut and Mom. cut
- FPcut_comp.C is based on FP.C
--> w/o FP cut and w/ FP cut
- FPmom_comp.C is based on simc_fp3.C
--> w/ FP cut and w/ FP&Mom. cut

Acceptance

--> SIMC/rootfile/okuyamacro/acceptanceL_2022.C
--> ../result_2D_2022_tripleDCS.C (2D map)

SIMC Radiative tail
--> ../radiative_2022.C

MEA_syst.C
--> Systematic uncertainties of Mixed Event Analysis

kaonSR.C
--> Draw #eps(Decay)
--> almost same as PathLength/kaonSR_2022.C

hole_SS.C
--> Draw SS hit patern (provided from Itabashi-san on Feb. 13, 2023)

Multifoil_dist.C
--> Draw Multifoil distribution with h2all_Multi_Hkin.root

Chi2FP.C
--> Calculate efficiencies of FP & Chi2 cuts
(FP.C was before the Mom. cut)
