*tuning_ac_oku.cc
Macrofile for tuning AC counters.
This concept is based on hrs_tuningAC.h (by Itabashi-san),
but the analysis inside is taken over from ana_Lambda.cc

--0531th1.copy 
Backup of tuning_ac_oku.cc. When I make graphs of Survival Ratio vs th1
--0531th2u.copy

*gain_all_segment.cc
This can fit all AC segments' ADC distribution and get 1p.e. position, run by run.
This information is stored in "gain_run111???.dat"

*each_graph.cc
This shows all AC segments' run dependences from "gain_run111???.dat"
2 x 2 display


These files should be under this directry.

*Tree.cc

*ParamMan.h
TDC offset, etc.
