If you want to get "Acceptance", every vpflux***.cc will work. same program.
If you want to get "VP Flux Integral", you need to care its algorithm.


vpflux_mc.cc
- Monte Carlo Integral

vpflux.cc
- Monte Carlo (Acceptance) & Function integration by quadrature
- Gamma(omega,theta) x (Delta p) x (Delta Omega ~10msr)
- Solid angle is not divided into bins.

vpflux_improved
- Monte Carlo (Acceptance) & Function integration by quadrature
- Solid angle can be divided into bins.
- More realistic function integration

See ELS#100(Okuyama)
Monte Carlo method is the best, maybe.(2020/8/7)
I recommend using vpflux_mc.cc
